Design Decisions

Historical net worth
- write one value per year
- always make Jan 1 the start of a new year
- whenever asset/debt updated, check in DB for existing net worth value for that year, and if it exists, overwrite
- cannot use date purchased to calculate net worth because there is no way to go back and determine the market value of the assets at any given time

Asset value calculations
- always use the market value to calculate net worth, trends, graphs etc.
- the market value will also be the one to get updated when we have Finance API

Post retirement
Thought about doing withdrawal trend post retirement. But this is pretty much impossible because there is no way to determine
future portfolio performance. Eg. if one year the market tanks by 50%, your withdrawal picture looks VERY different.
- this is potentially doable with a monte carlo calculation doing all the possible scenarios
